             <p>-"People who continue to put their liver on the line to defend their faith become heroes and continue to exist on in legend " is one of the things he has said that touched my heart </p>
             
             <br>
<p>He was called the moster of his village since he was kid he lost his parents the day he was born but even so he never gave up and now he is the most loved character (not only in the real world)but also in his nation </p><br>
